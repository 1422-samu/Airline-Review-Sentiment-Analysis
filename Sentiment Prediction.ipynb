      "qatar airways generous covid policy made this flight air canada's ridiculousness almost caused me to miss my connecting flight to qatar but the stress that could have caused me was completely alleviated by qatar's staff assuring me that any cancellation prior to take off would receive a full refund directly to the method of payment this generous policy during covid times really made me very thankful and they deserve praise for it that bumps up the review overall though because the in air experience is not great the on ground experience is perfect with great boarding great staff support great call support great privilege club benefits and so on but in the air i was greeted with an oldish plane and below average seating the seats were somehow smaller than even i have become accustomed to in recent years the entertainment system was alright but slightly laggy and the headphones provided were awful the food was of acceptable quality though the lunch provided between the two meals was below average it was a boring bland roll the wifi is only 10 dollars but privilege club members get one hour for free i believe students get it for free in general but i was not able to get that to work the wifi was pretty great quality easily able to support youtube streaming connectivity was good as long as you were over land and not water obviously qatar could do quite a bit to improve their seating and entertainment but in other customer service they were superb for this flight\n",

      "auckland to london return with a side trip to japan flights between auckland and seoul were on older 747s but there is more legroom than other airlines entertainment was average and quite limited and generally worked well overnight accommodation on the way to the uk via seoul was a bonus transport and organisation for this was very easy and efficient both at the airport and the hotel flights to and from japan were on new 777 and 737 meals were superb and the kids pack on this leg was much better than on others flights between seoul and uk were good to this time on newer 777 the korean food on the long haul legs was excellent western meals and wine choices were not so good the service was outstanding very friendly and helpful and plenty of water and soft drinks supplied kids meals on the flights were vast which was good as lots of options were provided on the tray which was helpful as the kids could pick and choose they were very well organised with kids meals came and checked that everything was in order and were flexible if children were sleeping at meal times every check in was easy and quick boarding was straightforward and the children were well catered for we were encouraged to board early with them transfers at incheon were great it is easy to see why this airport rates as it does it is just superb our flight to japan left from gimpo airport nothing like incheon but fine and getting there from incheon was really easy my only gripe is that while the one check in bag rule is enforced the one carry on rule is not lots of passengers wheeled large suitcases onto the plane in addition to bulky carry on bags and backpacks which meant that there was stiff competition for space in the overhead compartments and people were pretty ruthless about claiming their space overall korean airlines was a great option for us and we would use them again they are extremely competitive price wise and are considerably cheaper than the next cheapest option having the stopover included between auckland and the uk is a luxury particularly when travelling with children\n",

      "when we arrived at beijing airport at 10 30 pm to check in for our flight to paris we were told that the flight was delayed to 5 50 in the morning due to thunderstorm i could not believe that as we had previously flown in much worse weather it was not even raining but i will not argue with the decision air china made as safety is a priority we were already so tired and we were not happy as our return flight to korea with air china had already been rescheduled inconveniently it was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so it was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in paris i asked the air china duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid beijing weather i am very unhappy with how we were dealt with one of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us furthermore he said he would do anything he could for us so i requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call after he was on the phone for a short time he said unfortunately there were no rooms available as much as we were frustrated and annoyed i thought he could not really do anything more for us at that time i asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least so if any rooms became available we could get one he said that was not a problem and he said our names were on the list although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative i wish i grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie after we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as i wanted to double check our names were actually on the waiting list they informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay we explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that air china said they were not willing to pay for it with the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the air china duty manager but of course he would not answer the phone i also called the customer service desk of air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold the lady told me that she could not help because i chose english therefore the line went through to la air china so that she could not help us i do not know where to begin to complain about this situation the way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable first of all how the manager lied to our faces like that i still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers i have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company if customer service is only for chinese speaking people and english speakers only get a dummy speaker and they cannot actually help anyone with the problems they might as well be up front about it then they could have saved my time and money for making all the international calls like an idiot at 2am in the morning i emailed the customer service all i got was the number that i originally called in the first place ridiculous\n",

      "we had the most horrific experience with emirates travelling from spain to sydney our flight was delayed by an hour from barcelona we let the crew know multiple times that we had a connection to catch they told us not to worry there'll be ground crew waiting for us once we land and will make sure we do not miss our connection but emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight this was 6 hrs before landing once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid way the emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation they are rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew also both my partner i had picked up a cold virus not covid got the negative pcr and felt horrible we were both feverish barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly first they gave us seats far away from each other twice i could not understand how they could make the same mistake twice second they told us we cannot get the exit row seat we would paid extra for they told me it was not their responsibility to refund the money and i should request if from emirates i just requested that we would not be seated near any small babies and they said fine they kept telling us to collect our luggage but with the condition my partner and i were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up it was impossible so we said no since no one was helping and it was 3 am we thought to go and check in to our hotel sleep we were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it go visit the dubai expo and all but things just started getting worst we were in nightmarish state until we got home we had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel the emirates crew at the airport entrance could not help us with expo tickets cause they did not care we had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours and the hotel had no amenities after multiple arguments the meal problem was fixed which was not that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries we would to go and buy clothes toothbrush deodorant etc for ourselves which was a waste of money the hotel could not even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining we survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine were actually not we ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration there were empty seats at the end of the plane they just did not bother to check for us i did ask for a change of seat at the gate and in flight and every time i was told there were no empty seats we arrived at syd airport in a chaotic situation to collect our luggage they would given the wrong belt so everyone spent an hour at luggage collection\n",

      "bangkok to london via beijing i have never written a review before but i am so appalled by air china's service that i need to warn others my flight from bangkok to beijing was delayed due to snow in beijing which meant that i missed my connecting flight from china to london i was not mad at this as bad weather conditions cannot be helped but the staff at air china were unhelpful beyond belief were not accommodating or understanding at all and did not even have the customer service to even apologise for the inconvenience 10 stranded brits were appalled by the way air china handed the inconvenience and that all air china did was put us on the same flight the next day and barked at us that they would arrange a hotel for us to make things worse not only could air china then not retrieve our luggage which we asked for after we waited for it for over 2 hours telling us rudely to just wait more it took them a total of 4 hours from when we landed to take and just leave us at a hotel without even translating what had happened to the hotel staff we all then were left to argue against the hotel staff about an agreement that they had in place with air china which was that it was two people to a double room regardless of who and if we wanted a single room to ourselves we had to pay which meant that we had to stay in a room with complete strangers absolutely ridiculous and unsafe the hotel staff were equally not accommodating or understanding we were provided with food but were only allowed one bottle of water per person for the night the next day we asked air china if anything could be done for the massive inconvenience and just got a rude no i am disgusted at the way air china operate and their rude staff and could not believe that they treated us like the inconvenience was our fault it was so stressful and looking back to the events it is unbelievable how we have been treated when i asked to speak to the manager about how long we had to wait for our transport to our hotel he just barked at me in limited english telling me to just wait it will be soon it is disgusting customer service and attitude i urge people to not use them as it is not worth saving a bit of money to be treated in this way and ruining your holiday\n",

      "flew sydney to amsterdam returning from paris to sydney both via singapore in july i had researched premium economy with sia the flight on a380 tended to be more comfortable with more room boarding in sydney was chaotic and confusing the a350 seat to amsterdam was very uncomfortable front row and the foot rest was redundant i am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if i wanted more if was begrudgingly offered food book the cook was okay considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely if ever were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed this was more for the convenience of fa who were moving between premium and economy with food trolleys etc many economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin especially when nursing crying babies also noise especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in a380 flights very noisy even with noise cancelling headphones certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost i do not feel it was anywhere near value for money my biggest concern and complaint which i made to fa and even to sia customer service on cdg to sin flight july 15 was when parents left their two boys in premium economy while they took themselves off to business class they did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices i had to stop them from damaging the lights the window shutters clambering over their seats especially the young boy of 4 5 years the fa cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers in this day and age this is a big concern anything could have happened to the boys what if there was an emergency who would look after them they became very restless and eventually i complained to fa but nothing was done the parents were inconsiderate selfish and irresponsible singapore airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax as a passenger why should anyone's flight be disrupted and stressful due to others' selfishness as in this case this is not about whatever class your in airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone's sake also if anything happened to the children who is liable the other passengers the airline would i fly sia premium economy again i seriously doubt it it has potential but if they do not deliver on their marketing promises i will fly other airlines who do also it is unsatisfying that they cannot even respond to a written complaint if you over promise and under deliver consistently you have dissatisfied customers this was over 4 flights and i felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall\n",

      "had a disastrous experience with emirates recently i was supposed to fly from new dehli to dubai on a direct flight taking off at 9 50 pm when we just arrived at the airport with my colleague we learned already that the flight would be delayed and eta planned at 00 00 just 15 min before the planned new departure still no news i had to go and try to get some info to be informed by chance that the flight has to land in lucknow 40 min away from dehli for weather conditions but a few more minutes to refuel and the flight would bridge at dehli planned new departure 1 40am we then learned around 1 20 am that the flight would be delayed until 7 30 pm with no further explanations the whole crowd started to get mad complaining vocally to the staff who had no explanation to give i learned by chance again afterwards that the flying staff was on too many extra hours and had to rest before re flying emirates did not anticipate this obvious issue that made the flight to dubai impossible for a long time after more than 1 hour of complaining and shouting and no answers from the staff a passenger took the lead and had to inform everyone that anyway our only solution would be to collect back our luggage and try to find an alternative flight if any i decided to call emirates who booked me on the 11 am flight as the 4 14 am flights with all the mess around would not be catchable for any of us despite the fact that 26 seats were still available due to the boarding pass issue it took us another hour to go through the passport control back in a chaotic situation and finally get our luggage back emirates claimed that they would offer us a hotel and breakfast but getting out of the airport we discovered that the 360 passengers we waiting on a parking lot for buses to come to drive us 40 min away from the airport it would take 2 hours to get our room and it was already 4 30 am we decided to avoid the mess and stay at the airport with no sleep and not even a single bottle of water given by emirates at 7 am when we checked in again and complained about our dreadful experience the staff claimed that it was well managed emirates offering us a hotel room and a breakfast it drove me mad and i asked to talk to the most senior emirates staff member at the airport i could not talk to him as he was busy in a meeting not even considering the fair complaint of an angry customer he just did not care i am flying 100 days a year for the last 15 years and it is the most painful experience i had so far not only the situation was tough but the staff was totally incapable to inform us of anything letting us wait for hours for nothing and only the buzz around informed us then the situation was managed in hours in a totally disorganized and disrespectful manner please all run away from this company\n",

      "chiang mai to bangkok i have flown more than 1 000 times with over more than 100 airlines and i have never had a thought about needing to write a review for one until now i feel it is best to warn people to avoid this airline my gf booked this airline even though we read the numerous negative review but thought that the price was cheap enough to give it a try on a short 1 hour domestic flight the service is the absolute worst and the most unprofessional i have ever seen in my life rude and untrained unqualified staff i had to call their manager over and while he was trying to defend his staff accidentially quoted a rule in their airline which completely rejects his defence was really not helpful either all he did was try to back up his staff without any reason i guess thats what they get taught for this airline defend you staff first no matter how wrong they are really poor customer service the worst i have ever seen they literally treat you with no respect 100 your flight will be delayed and even though its delay the staff will insist you arrive 1 30 hour before the original time even if your flight is delayed for 2 hours that means they want you to sit there and wait for about 3 4 hours before your flight even though they know that their flight is delayed since the morning on top of that the rudeness of their staff makes you wondering if any of them went through any training at all and remember this is for a 1 hour flight now i know everyone experience a “bad” flight once in a while but to experience the exact same thing for both flights there and back is ridiculous being a low cost airline with all the hidden costs like for baggage it is really not cheaper than similar airlines like air asia but i really would recommend you spend a little more for the piece of mind again if you dont want to face any disappointment and worst service you will experience avoid this airline at all cost\n",

      "brisbane to zurich via dubai after hearing nothing but great things about emirates i have been left so disappointed our first leg from brisbane to dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but i had to ask them again for the second meal approximately 4 hours out from dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above after 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us following this there was no in flight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight no compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident after our dreadful flight and poor service from brisbane i asked at heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to brisbane were fully booked this was not true as the dubai to brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves the check in procedure at heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes there were no toilets in the lounges at heathrow and dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again our flight from london departed at 9pm my daughter didn’t end up getting her meal until 11 50pm it took them 2 5hrs to commence the meal service the flight from dubai to brisbane was no better my 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadn’t been cleaned my 7 year old fell asleep on take off so i asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up i was told this was not a problem however when i asked for it 7 hours later i was told we she couldn’t have as they couldn’t reheat it i then had to ask if i could at least get the other food that didn’t require being reheated the customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling the flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly on one flight i pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and no one attended at all – the plane landed 1 5 hours after i pressed the buzzer and we disembarked i could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence on top of this the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous at one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet we got up to go to the toilet and i was told i would be going at our own risk it felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work i have travelled extensively for the past 20 years and emirates is the worst airline i have ever flown with do not waste your money i will never fly with them again\n",

      "we checked in at about 8am for our amsterdam bangalore flight that was to depart at 10 50am on 29th may there were other transit passengers who had come from elsewhere in europe and us the flight was to take off from gate g12 this must be the worst gate at schipol airport the gate area in poor repair far away from restaurants shops and no aero bridge to board the aircraft at schipol jet airways have their staff but perhaps in limited numbers klm provides ground support to jet airways no jet airways staff were visible at our gate starting 10 45am they made a series of announcements about flight delay finally at about 12 noon they asked us to collect refreshment coupon from the gate counter and it was worth euro 2 50 for that amount you get a bottle of water at schipol and most of us hadn’t had any breakfast some passengers starting tweeting furiously perhaps as a reaction to this at about 12 45pm klm staff asked us to collect lunch coupons but they also told us not to leave the gate area as they would have flight updates soon remember that there are no food outlets in or close to gate g12 eventually at about 1 45pm they announced flight cancelation and asked us to go to transfer desk 4 to arrange alternate flights klm ground staff turned us away from transfer desk 4 as it was very crowded and asked us to go to transfer desk 6 this was no less crowded we stood in the queue for about 4 hours we were inching towards the desk at which time the klm staff decided to close the desk and asked us to go to transfer desk 4 and another long wait began some passengers were being accommodated in the flight departing the same day on such crazy routing as amsterdam kuala lumpur colombo bangalore while the original flight was a direct non stop flight no one was being upgraded but the viciousness of klm ground staff was their own and through all this chaos no jet airways staff was visible finally at about 9 30pm i was given boarding passes for a klm flight to dubai the following day a very long transit in dubai and connecting onto an emirates flight to bangalore i was asked to meet some other klm staff in the arrival area for a hotel i had a valid visa and could do that but many others had to spend hours to get a visa then were told it was too late to give them hotels they spent overnight at the airport no dinner coupons either no one was given toiletries or money for change of clothes flights can get cancelled sometimes but how an airline handles the situation determines the quality of the airline jet airways failed miserably so did klm ground staff\n",

      "trivandrum to new york via dubai i have been a regular customer on emirates airlines for the last 5 years and chose this airline over many others because of the great service in the past however in my most recent travels i have experienced poor management of flight connections in dubai airport due to this i have missed several flights to new york have been stranded in dubai for days have lost or missed my baggage or have had to run at top speed to barely make it to my gate on time there is technically only a tight 1 hour and 15 minute layover in dubai but lately the flight from trv to dubai has been arriving 30 45 minutes late due to an inability to get a gate this of course suggests poor planning and organizing on your airline’s behalf this delay leaves about 20 minutes for us to deboard the plane figure out our new gate clear security twice and arrive at our departing flight it is almost impossible to do this especially for customers who are first time travelers older disabled or impaired as an asthmatic the marathon run i had to make from terminal c to terminal a led to bad wheezing and could have resulted in a medical emergency if i had not carried my inhaler several times we only barely made our dubai to jfk flight because we paid for preferred seats in the front of the plane allowing us to leave quickly despite experiencing this incredibly stressful connection emirates staff provides no support to help us off the flight quickly in fact on our december 12th flight when we alerted the flight attended about our very tight connection ek201 was already boarding when we landed she dismissively told us “everyone has a connection flight not just you” she also argued with my father and i for 5 minutes further delaying our exit from the plane this is poor management and could be remedied by announcing the names of passengers with very tight connections however it seems emirates no longer cares about their customers due to our marathon run we did make our flight on december 12th but my relief was short lived we were informed that all 3 of our checked bags were not loaded and would instead arrive on ek203 on december 13th at 8 00 am on december 13th i called the emirates number for baggage services at 9am and was told my bags had arrived and jfk and needed to clear customs before it was delivered to my home i was also informed that i would be updated on my baggage status which did not occur my family and i were put through hell to get our baggage back we had to contact emirates 5 7 times within the day at one point a chat service agent gave us conflicting information insisting that our baggage was still in dubai despite being told otherwise many times ultimately after and exhausting flight and while still jetlagged we had to stay up until 2 30 am calling both emirates and the delivery company bex every hour till our bags were delivered due to the issues detailed above my family and i have decided to no longer fly emirates i used to be a loyal customer but your company has really gone down the drain these past few flights and loyalty is not a good enough reason to suffer during my travels horrible service horrible airline\n",

      "danang ho chi minh bangkok to save a little money when in vietnam vietjet air emailed and sent text to my thai mobile to notify me of a delay to my hcm city to bangkok flight a few days later upon check in at danang airport for 1 20 pm flight i was notified of 2 hr delay i told agent i would miss connection in hcm city as i needed to exit the domestic terminal check in at the international terminal she said they emailed me but i had no email or text notification as i had received previously at the vj ticketing desk the clerk only kept repeating in an unsympathetic tone that she was sorry and would refund money for flight from danang to hcm city i told her that i still needed to get to hcm city this did not solve my problem she said buy a ticket on vietnam airlines – full price last minute 3 times what vj was refunding me she offered no other options when i asked if vj would make any accommodation for their delay she admitted that even though the delay was vj’s fault it is corporate policy to just refund cost and i would have to pay for a new ticket on another airline another handful of passengers arrived with connection problems as vietnam airlines had a flight at 1 25 pm it was after 12 noon i decided to just pay for the ticket in hcm city checking in for vj flight to bkk i was asked if i am checking any baggage i said no i would bring my bag with me on the plane agent asked to weigh my luggage 12 kg – just 5 kg over the 7 kg limit but size of bag was fine ticket agent i have to pay to check in my bag i told her that as a result of vj’s delayed flight in danang i paid 3 times what vj refunded for a vietnam airlines flight to hcm city no sense of customer service no acknowledgement for ridiculous hassle and extra expense just constantly repeating that it is corporate policy i had to pay to check my bag the vietjet air customer service representative just repeatedly asked me whether i had read their 7 kg limit when i booked my flight i reminded her that the 2 hr delay in danang was their fault and i paid 3 times the cost of my original vj flight for a new ticket after checking my booking she says with gritted teeth that because of the inconvenience “i’m going to let you carry on your bag ” it cost vj nothing to let me carry on my bag it would have gone a long way with any customer with a bad experience to pretend to listen fake a little understanding and say in a kind tone “i’m so sorry about all the inconvenience today i will let the agents know that you can carry your bag on please have a nice flight ” this flight landed an hour late in bangkok parked far away so a longer than usual bus ride just to get to the main airport horrible experience saving a little money up front cost me more money and a lot of stress and aggravation\n",
